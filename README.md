# CSCI360FinalProject
Final project for CSCI 360: Software Architecture, Testing, and Security. Improving upon Ticketmaster-esque apps for reserving tickets in a venue. Written by Joel Saldana, Vivian Nguyen, and Michelle Clark with the coding assistance of available LLM technology.  

Brief Description: 

The ticketing app provides a payment system for student, faculty members, and non CofC users to view, purchase, and reserve seats in CofC-owned stadiums, theatres, and auditoriums. Users will also be able to cancel reservations or transfer tickets. 

There will be a set amount of seats reserved for certain populations (faculty, handicap, etc.). Seats of different tiers will be offered for different prices. While the app will be open to non-students, students and faculty will receive ticket discounts. 

The app will securely use credit card information for payment for reservations. The app will also accept other contactless payment systems, like Apple Pay, PayPal, and Google Pay. Tickets will be available online, to print, or to pick up at the box office. These provided functions solve the problem of current decentralized payment systems for various events at CofC.
